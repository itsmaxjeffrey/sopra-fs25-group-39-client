# Contributions

Every member has to complete at least 2 meaningful tasks per week, where a
single development task should have a granularity of 0.5-1 day. The completed
tasks have to be shown in the weekly TA meetings. You have one "Joker" to miss
one weekly TA meeting and another "Joker" to once skip continuous progress over
the remaining weeks of the course. Please note that you cannot make up for
"missed" continuous progress, but you can "work ahead" by completing twice the
amount of work in one week to skip progress on a subsequent week without using
your "Joker". Please communicate your planning **ahead of time**.

Note: If a team member fails to show continuous progress after using their
Joker, they will individually fail the overall course (unless there is a valid
reason).

**You MUST**:

- Have two meaningful contributions per week.

**You CAN**:

- Have more than one commit per contribution.
- Have more than two contributions per week.
- Link issues to contributions descriptions for better traceability.

**You CANNOT**:

- Link the same commit more than once.
- Use a commit authored by another GitHub user.

ADDITIONAL NOTE FOR WEEK 4:

@dariohug had some progress that was overwritten by @ojg9 push into main (FE).
To solve the issue, Dario reverted back to his last commit and we all made tha
changed of @ojg9 manually and added them back. @ojg9 commits are visible under
[link](https://github.com/itsmaxjeffrey/sopra-fs25-group-39-client/compare/main...back_up_21_april_15_56_before_merge).
We(Oli, Max and Dario) appologize if this makes our repo looks more confusing
and makes it harder for the TAs to find the commits.

Due to this issue(codes being overwritten or lost after merge-rebase), our team
decided to work on the main branch in order to avoid more obstacles like this,
since we have a limited time before the deadline. Thank you for your
understanding.
